// Progress represents a follower’s progress in the view of the leader. Leader
// maintains progresses of all followers, and sends entries to the follower
// based on its progress.
//
// NB(tbg): Progress is basically a state machine whose transitions are mostly
// strewn around `*raft.raft`. Additionally, some fields are only used when in a
// certain State. All of this isn't ideal.

	// RecentActive is true if the progress is recently active. Receiving any messages
	// from the corresponding follower indicates the progress is active.

	RecentActive bool //leader接收到心跳的答复后会标记活跃状态

// ProgressMap is a map of *Progress.
