// Progress represents a followerâ€™s progress in the view of the leader. Leader
// maintains progresses of all followers, and sends entries to the follower
// based on its progress.
//
// NB(tbg): Progress is basically a state machine whose transitions are mostly
// strewn around `*raft.raft`. Additionally, some fields are only used when in a
// certain State. All of this isn't ideal.
